# Template to bootstrap a Botkit project for Cisco Spark

This template regroups a set of best practices:

- configuration: pass settings either through environment variables on the command line, or hard-cod values in the `.env` file. Note that command line variables are priorized over the `.env`file if present in both places.

- skills: organize your bot behaviours by placing 'hear commands', 'convos' and 'events' in the [skills directory](skills/README.md). The bot comes with a ".commons", "help", "fallback" and "welcome" skills.

- user experience: comes with a 'welcome' invite, as well as help and 'fallback' commands, ready to be customized for your own bot purpose.

- healthcheck: easilly check that everything goes well by hitting the `ping` endpoint automatically exposed.

- metadata: expose extra info via command and on a public address so that Spark users can inquire on Bot Author / Legal mentions / Healthcheck endpoint...

- mentions: the enrichCommand utility helps you add mentions in Group spaces.


## How to run

Assuming you plan to expose your bot via [ngrok](https://ngrok.com),
you can run this template in a snatch.

1. Create a Bot Account from the ['Spark for developers' bot creation page](https://developer.ciscospark.com/add-bot.html), and copy your bot's access token.

2. Launch ngrok to expose port 3000 of your local machine to the internet:

    ```sh
    ngrok http 3000
    ```

    Pick the HTTPS address that ngrok is now exposing. Note that ngrok exposes HTTP and HTTPS protocols, make sure to pick the HTTPS address.

3. [Optional] Open the `.env` file and modify the settings to accomodate your bot.

    _Note that you can also specify any of these settings via env variables. In practice, the values on the command line or in your machine env will prevail over .env file settings_

    To successfully run your bot, you'll need to specify a PUBLIC_URL for your bot, and a Cisco Spark API token (either in the .env settings or via env variables). In the example below, we do not modify any value in settings and specify all configuration values on the command line.

4. You're ready to run your bot

    From a bash shell:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-ciscospark-samples
    cd template
    npm install
    SPARK_TOKEN=0123456789abcdef PUBLIC_URL=https://abcdef.ngrok.io node bot.js
    ```

    From a windows shell:

    ```shell
    > git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-ciscospark-samples
    > cd template
    > npm install
    > set SPARK_TOKEN=0123456789abcdef
    > set PUBLIC_URL=https://abcdef.ngrok.io
    > node bot.js
    ```

    where:

    - SPARK_TOKEN is the API access token of your Cisco Spark bot
    - PUBLIC_URL is the root URL at which Cisco Spark can reach your bot
    - [ngrok](http://ngrok.com) helps you expose the bot running on your laptop to the internet, type: `ngrok http 3000` to launch
